And because we are friends with Bill Sheehan, we really want you to go to https://buybigfootbooks.com and buy some of Bill\'s books.  The collection contains hundreds of personal REAL bigfoot encounters that people sent to Bill via letter, phone calls and email.  They are awesome books and make really great gifts.  We really, actually love Bill; such a great guy and that\'s why we want you do break out your credit or debit card or.. maybe you could just hand him a fistful of sweaty cash and buy a whole case of his books.  They make really great gifts!';
